This project implements a factory model with item collection using the "parts to picker" method, in which items are transported to stations using autonomous robots. 
The items are stored in pods. When an item is required for an order, the robot drives under the required locker, picks it up and moves it to the picking station. 

The goal of the project is to evaluate the performance of this system through simulation, under different parameter values. 

The system is based on model M1 from: 

Lamballais, T., Roy, D., & De Koster, M. B. M. (2017). Estimating performance in a robotic mobile fulfillment system. European Journal of Operational Research, 256(3), 976-990.
